## MotionLayout RecyclerView Sample
Sample project that demonstrates the use of MotionLayout in RecycleView.

## Overview
-----------------------------

### This show use of MotionLayout as an item in RecyclerView

* [MainActivity.java](https://github.com/androidx/constraintlayout/blob/main/demoProjects/ExamplesRecyclerView/app/src/main/java/com/example/motionrecycle/MainActivity.java)
 the recycler view code
* [res/layout/motion_item.xml](https://github.com/androidx/constraintlayout/blob/main/demoProjects/ExamplesRecyclerView/app/src/main/res/layout/motion_item.xml)
 the layout used as an item containing the MotionLayout
* [res/xml/motion_item_scene.xml](https://github.com/androidx/constraintlayout/blob/main/demoProjects/ExamplesRecyclerView/app/src/main/res/xml/motion_item_scene.xml)

### MotionLayout in Recycler view showing how to cache the states of active motionLayouts

Implementation may vary but typically you will need to cache and reflect some parts of the state of a MotionLayout before they atach to other views.
You may also need to update the state of MotionLayout as infomation in the backend changes.

This is a simple implementation of a series of timers.

* [MotionRecycler2.java](https://github.com/androidx/constraintlayout/blob/main/demoProjects/ExamplesRecyclerView/app/src/main/java/com/example/motionrecycle/MotionRecycler2.java) Contains all the recycler view code
* [res/layout/timer_item.xml](https://github.com/androidx/constraintlayout/blob/main/demoProjects/ExamplesRecyclerView/app/src/main/res/layout/timer_item.xml)
is the layout used as an item containing the MotionLayout
* [res/xml/timer_item_scene.xml](https://github.com/androidx/constraintlayout/blob/main/demoProjects/ExamplesRecyclerView/app/src/main/res/xml/timer_item_scene.xml)
